# Introduction to Git and Github

## Week 1

- `diff` command shows the changes between two files
- `diff -u` -> Shows the changes in a unified format (Entire file will be shown, `+`, `-` signs depicting lines added or removed)
- Other tools for comparing two files
  - meld
  - kdiff3
  - vimdiff

- `patch` command applies the changes from a **patch file** generated by the `diff` command

```sh
patch file_name < patch_file_name
```

- `git config` helps to set-up configruation values like `user.name`, `user.email` etc
- `git config -l` shows all the configuration values

- `git show <COMMIT-HASH>` will show a single commit and the changes associated with it
- `git log --stat` shows the number of lines added/removed in a commit
- `git diff --staged` shows the change(s) between previous commit and the staged files

## Deleting/Renaming Files

- `git rm <file-name>` removes the file from directory + stages the change for the next commit
- `git mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name>` renames a file in the directory and stages the change for next commit

## Reverting Changes
- `git checkout <file-name>` will update the files to the last stored snapshot of the file
- `git checkout -p <file-name>` will ask which changes to update to the last stored snapshot of the file

- `git reset` is the opposite of `git add`
- `git reset HEAD <file-name>` will unstage a staged file
- `git reset HEAD -p <file-name>` will unstage a staged file
