# Introduction to Git and Github

## Week 1

- `diff` command shows the changes between two files
- `diff -u` -> Shows the changes in a unified format (Entire file will be shown, `+`, `-` signs depicting lines added or removed)
- Other tools for comparing two files
  - meld
  - kdiff3
  - vimdiff

- `patch` command applies the changes from a **patch file** generated by the `diff` command

```sh
patch file_name < patch_file_name
```

- `git config` helps to set-up configruation values like `user.name`, `user.email` etc
- `git config -l` shows all the configuration values

- `git show <COMMIT-HASH>` will show a single commit and the changes associated with it
- `git log --stat` shows the number of lines added/removed in a commit
- `git log --graph --oneline` will show a graphical view of the commit history 
- `git diff --staged` shows the change(s) between previous commit and the staged files

## Deleting/Renaming Files

- `git rm <file-name>` removes the file from directory + stages the change for the next commit
- `git mv <old_file_name> <new_file_name>` renames a file in the directory and stages the change for next commit

## Reverting Changes
- `git checkout <file-name>` will update the files to the last stored snapshot of the file
- `git checkout -p <file-name>` will ask which changes to update to the last stored snapshot of the file

- `git reset` is the opposite of `git add`
- `git reset HEAD <file-name>` will unstage a staged file
- `git reset HEAD -p <file-name>` will unstage a staged file

- `git commit --amend` will run the commit workflow on staged files, and over-write the previous commit

## Rollback

- `git revert` will create a new commit, that is the opposite of everything in the referenced commit
- Example `git revert HEAD`


- `git log -n` will display log for the last n commits


## Branches

- `git branch <branch-name>` will create a branch
- `git checkout <branch-name>` will switch to that branch
- `git checkout -b <branch-name>` will create a new branch and switch to it
- `git branch -d <branch-name>` will delete a branch

## Merging Branches

### Algorithms
- `Fast-Forward` : All the commits in one branch are there in the other branch with some additional commits. So git will just update the first branch to point to the latest commit of the second branch
- `Three Way Merge` : There are different commits on different branches, so git will take changes from both branches and put them in a new commit. This might result in Conflicts

### Merge Conflicts
- When two branches update the same part of the same file

- `git merge <branch-name>` will merge the current checked out branch with the branch-name
- `git merge --abort` will stop the merge


## Github

- Remote repository management service
- `remote` reference to the remote repository
- `git remote -v` lets us know the URL for our remote repository
- `git remote show <remote-name>` will show the details of remote repository
- `git branch -r` will show all remote branches
